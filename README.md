# Hotel-reviews

# Gathering_and_cleaning_data.ipynb
Manipulating a hotel review dataset to allow:
(1) Sentiment analysis - analysis of the user satisfaction based on the review
(2) Competitive analysis - compare the outcome of sentiment analysis based on location (based on latitude and longitude)

# postgresql
Importing the dataset into a postgresql database system and ensuring data integrity
Key points:
(1) setting primary keys
(2) setting correct datatypes
(3) creating a custom rule to prevent data duplication
(4) testing the robustness (not allowing penetration) of the table
(5) giving permissions on a need-to-know basis (note: there are no intentions of analysing the data - this situation is only hypothetical and for practice purposes, so no permissions have been given)
