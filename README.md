# Hotel-reviews

# Gathering_and_cleaning_data.ipynb
Manipulating a hotel review dataset to allow:
(1) Sentiment analysis - analysis of the user satisfaction based on the review
(2) Competitive analysis - compare the outcome of sentiment analysis based on location (based on latitude and longitude)

# postgresql - data integrity
Importing the data into a postgresql database system
Key points:
-setting primary keys
-setting correct datatypes
-creating a custom rule to prevent data duplication
-testing the robustness (not allowing penetration) of the table
-giving permissions on a need-to-know basis (note: there are no intentions of analysing the data - this situation is only hypothetical and for practice purposes)
